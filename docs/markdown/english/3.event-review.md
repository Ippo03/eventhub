# UC3. Event Evaluation

**Primary Actor:** Customer  
**Stakeholders:** 

**Customer:** Wants to be able to publicly share their experience for a specific event, as well as to express their preference for an event they are interested in attending.  
**Organizer:** Wants to receive evaluations to see where improvements can be made.

**Preconditions:** 
1) The customer must have created an account and be logged in.
2) The customer must have attended the event for which they intend to leave a review.

## Basic Flow
### A) Event Evaluation
1) The customer clicks on the "My Events" button from the menu.
2) The system displays a list of all the events the customer has attended (active and inactive).
3) The customer selects the inactive event they want to evaluate.
4) The system displays more information about the event, as well as an "Evaluate" button.
5) The customer clicks on this button.
6) The system displays a form with two fields (Rating 1-10 and Comments).
7) The customer fills out the form and clicks the "Submit" button.
8) The system notifies the user that their review has been submitted.
9) The system updates the reviews and statistics for the specific event.

## Alternative Flows
*2a. The customer has not attended any event.*
   1. The system informs the user that they cannot leave a review for any event since they have not attended any.
   2. The use case terminates.

*7a. The customer did not fill in any field.*
   1. The system emphasizes that both fields are mandatory.
   2. The use case returns to step 7 of the basic flow.
